Hi! I'm Cameron.

I'm a software engineer who focuses mostly on building things for the web. I use a lot of tools and programming languages, but have a strong affinity for JavaScript and front-endy things like SVG, HTML, and CSS. I tend to frequent tech conferences. I write a lot of code and the occasional (actually, rather rare) blog post. I climb rocks and brew beer.

**Recruiters**: please do not contact me.

**Everyone else**: feel free to ping me at &lt;my first name&gt; @ &lt;this domain&gt;.
